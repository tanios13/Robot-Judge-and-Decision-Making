    "In this homework you will investigate the *causal* of being part of a union on the number of hours worked. You will work with data from the National Longitudinal Survey. In particular, you have a panel of young women who were between 14 and 26 years of age in 1968, surveyed for 20 years.\n",

Throughout the homework you will try to address the issue of **omitted variable bias** through different strategies, that will allow to make milder identification assumptions."
