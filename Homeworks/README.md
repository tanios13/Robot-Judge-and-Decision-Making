1. **06**: How does the DML works:

    The `LinearDML` estimator from the `econml` library is designed to estimate causal effects when you have a potentially large number of control variables that could confound the relationship between a treatment (or intervention) and an outcome. It does this using a two-stage process, leveraging machine learning models to control for the confounding variables.

    Here is a step-by-step explanation of what's happening in the process:

    ### First Stage: Control for Confounders
    1. **Predict the Outcome (`Y`)**: The `model_y`, which is a `LassoCV` in your case, is trained to predict the outcome variable (`Y`) using all the other variables except the treatment variable (`D`). It tries to learn the relationship between the covariates (X) and the outcome while using LASSO's capability of shrinking coefficients of less important variables to zero (variable selection).

    2. **Predict the Treatment (`D`)**: The `model_t`, a `LogisticRegressionCV` here, is used to predict the treatment variable (`D`). This is done to understand how the covariates might be influencing the likelihood of receiving the treatment. Since the treatment is discrete, logistic regression is an appropriate choice.

    During these steps, cross-validation (`cv=5`) is used to avoid overfitting and to select the best model parameters.

    ### Second Stage: Estimate Treatment Effect
    3. **Residuals from First Stage**: Once both models are fitted, they are used to predict `Y` and `D`. The predicted values are subtracted from the actual values to obtain residuals. These residuals represent the parts of `Y` and `D` that cannot be explained by the observed covariates (X) alone.

    4. **Estimate Treatment Effect**: The residuals from predicting `Y` are regressed on the residuals from predicting `D` using a linear model. This step is designed to capture the causal effect of `D` on `Y`, under the assumption that the models in the first stage have successfully controlled for all confounders.

    By using this two-step approach, the `LinearDML` method aims to isolate the effect of the treatment from all other influences. It effectively tries to mimic what would happen in a randomized controlled trial, where the only difference between groups is the treatment itself, not any other variables.

    The advantage of using `LinearDML` is that it can handle high-dimensional data where traditional econometric methods may fail or be impractical. It's a powerful tool for causal inference, especially when the true model is complex and the researcher believes that the machine learning models used in the first stage can adequately control for confounding factors.
